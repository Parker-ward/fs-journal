2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
    - parameters are names listed in the functions definition, an argument is the value passed to the function
3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
    - I don't know... i googled it but don't want to just "copy/paste" the answer... doesn't do me any good.
