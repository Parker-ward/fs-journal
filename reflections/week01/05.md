# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    - learning how wire-frames work.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
    - not all styling has to be done is CSS.   
- What are you struggling with?
    -I am struggling with being able to get my site to look good on all screen sizes
- What would you count as a victory?
    - I felt as the week went on I got more convidene in my abilities to code. Mid-week I was really questioning if I could do this!
