## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
  - Value Type
  - Reference Type
  - Pointer Type
2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
  - Bool
  - byte
  - char
  - decimal
  - double
  - enum
  - float
  - int
  - long
  - sbyte
  - short
  - struct
  - uint
  - ulong
  - ushort
    - C# has less Value-types than JavaScript also the value type in C# are a lot more specific. You can't make value type a number or a word you have to specifically lable what type of value you will be writing. 

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
 - Reference types get stored with an "address" and c# will call that address to grab that value.
