## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
  - a row holds the tables info, colums are individual "items or data"

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
  - CREATE TABLE
     characters(
      id NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      age VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
      description VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL
     ) default charset utf8 COMMENT'';

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;   - this is deleting data from the name colum
DROP TABLE table_name;    - this is deleting the name colum with in the table
```
